### Overview:
This python package simulates a biased random walk of E.coli as they seak out a food source. The biased walk is performed using a variation of gradient descent where E.coli move towards higher food concentrations. A more detailed explanation of the code and results are discussed in the report. A number of test cases are provided as an additional function in the simulation code and can be run to show different features of the simulation. This included different gradient types, different number of E.coli, different memory, etc. Additionally tracking plots can show the path of E.coli towards the food source and histogram plots show the distance from the food source for all E.coli in the system. Which plotting routines to run are specified by the run simulation function.
